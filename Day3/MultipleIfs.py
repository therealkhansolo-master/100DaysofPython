# You can write as many if statements as you need to check for different conditions that are unrelated to each other. Compare the code blocks below:

# # If/elif/else
# if <condition 1 is true>
#     <do A>
# elif <condition 2 is true>
#     <do B>
# else
#     <do C>
# # Nested if statements
# if <condition 1 is true>
#     <do A>
#     if <condition 2 is true>
#         <do B>
#         if <condition 3 is true>
#             <do C>
# # Multiple if statements
# if <condition 1 is true>
#     <do A>
# if <condition 2 is true>
#     <do B>
# if <condition 3 is true>
#     <do C>
# In the if/elif/else block, only one of A, B, or C can happen, because if/elif/else are mutually exclusive. The first condition has to fail to go into the elif and the elif (or multiple elif) have to fail to go into the else. Condition 2 is only checked if condition 1 is false.

# In the nested if statements, A, B and C can all happen, but conditions 1, 2 and 3 must all be true. The computer will only check condition 2 if condition 1 is true.

# In the multiple if statements, A, B, and C can all happen. But they are completely independent of each other. C can happen even if A and B don't. Every condition is checked, no matter the result of the others.
