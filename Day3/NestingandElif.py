# You can put if/else statements inside other if/else statements. This is known as nesting. e.g.

# if maths_score >= 90:
#     if english_score >= 90:
#         print("You're good at everything")
#     else:
#         print("You're good at maths")
# if english_score >= 90:
#     print("You're good at english)
# In this case only when a student has over 90 on maths and english, do they get "You are good at everything".

# Note: You can also have if statements that don't have a paired else statement.
